# Hosting git repositories

Gitolite allows you to setup git hosting on a central server, with
fine-grained access control and many more powerful features.

Here's more on [what][] it is, [how][] it works, [why][] you might need it,
and [who][] else is using it.

## #what What is gitolite?

Gitolite is an access control layer on top of git.  Here are the features that
most people see:

  * Use a single unix user ("real" user) on the server.
  * Provide access to many gitolite users:
      * they are not "real" users,
      * they do not get shell access.
  * Control access to many git repositories:
      * read access controlled at the repo level,
      * write access controlled at the branch/tag/file/directory level,
        including who can rewind, create, and delete branches/tags.
  * Can be installed without root access, assuming git and perl are already
    installed.
  * Authentication is most commonly done using sshd, but you can also use
    [http][] if you prefer (this may require root access).
